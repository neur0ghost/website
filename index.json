We examined aging trajectories of cortical thickness (CTh) and surface area in C9orf72 expansion adult carriers compared to healthy controls to characterize preclinical cerebral changes leading to symptoms.\nMethods: Data were obtained from the Genetic Frontotemporal Dementia Initiative. T1-weighted MRI scans were processed with CIVET 2.1 to extract vertex-wide CTh and CSA. Symptomatic and presymptomatic subjects were compared to age-matched controls using mixed-effects models, controlling for demographic variables. Aging trajectories were compared between carriers and non-carriers by testing the \u0026lsquo;age by genetic status\u0026rsquo; interaction. False-discovery rate corrections were applied to all vertex-wide analyses.\nResults: The sample included 640 scans from 386 subjects, including 54 symptomatic C9orf72 carriers (72.2% behavioral variant FTD), 83 asymptomatic carriers and 249 controls (age range 18-86). Symptomatic carriers showed fairly symmetric reduction in CTh/CSA in most of the frontal lobes, in addition to large temporo-parietal areas. Presymptomatic subjects had reduced CTh/CSA in more restricted areas of the medial fronto-parietal lobes, in addition to scattered lateral fronto-parieto-temporal areas. These differences were explained by faster cortical thinning linearly throughout adulthood in a similar anatomical distribution, with differences emerging in the early 30s. CSA reduction was also faster in mutation carriers predominantly in the ventro-frontal regions.\nInterpretation: C9orf72 mutation carriers have faster cortical thinning and surface loss throughout adulthood in regions that show atrophy in symptomatic subjects. This suggests that the pathogenic effects of the mutation lead to structural cerebral changes decades prior to symptoms.\n","date":1585699200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585699200,"objectID":"acdd918c7b6423102da0ccb7040a638d","permalink":"/publication/faster-cortical-thinning-and-surface-area-loss-in-presymptomatic-and-symptomatic-c9orf72-repeat-expansion-adult-carriers/","publishdate":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/faster-cortical-thinning-and-surface-area-loss-in-presymptomatic-and-symptomatic-c9orf72-repeat-expansion-adult-carriers/","section":"publication","summary":"C9orf72 mutation carriers have faster cortical thinning and surface loss throughout adulthood in regions that show atrophy in symptomatic subjects.

We aimed to investigate the value of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neuronal pentraxins (NPTXs), a family of proteins involved in homeostatic synapse plasticity, as novel biomarkers in genetic FTD.\nMethods: We included 106 presymptomatic and 54 symptomatic carriers of a pathogenic mutation in GRN, C9orf72 or MAPT, and 70 healthy non-carriers participating in the Genetic Frontotemporal dementia Initiative (GENFI), all of whom had at least one CSF sample. We measured CSF concentrations of NPTX2 using an in-house ELISA, and NPTX1 and NPTX receptor (NPTXR) by Western blot. We correlated NPTX2 with corresponding clinical and neuroimaging datasets as well as with CSF neurofilament light chain (NfL) using linear regression analyses.\nResults: Symptomatic mutation carriers had lower NPTX2 concentrations (median 643 pg/mL, IQR (301-872)) than presymptomatic carriers (1003 pg/mL (624-1358), p\u0026lt;0.001) and non-carriers (990 pg/mL (597-1373), p\u0026lt;0.001) (corrected for age). Similar results were found for NPTX1 and NPTXR. Among mutation carriers, NPTX2 concentration correlated with several clinical disease severity measures, NfL and grey matter volume of the frontal, temporal and parietal lobes, insula and whole brain. NPTX2 predicted subsequent decline in phonemic verbal fluency and Clinical Dementia Rating scale plus FTD modules. In longitudinal CSF samples, available in 13 subjects, NPTX2 decreased around symptom onset and in the symptomatic stage.\nDiscussion: We conclude that NPTX2 is a promising synapse-derived disease progression biomarker in genetic FTD.\n","date":1585699200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585699200,"objectID":"48e52eb116db2316cc9efeb8601c04ce","permalink":"/publication/neuronal-pentraxin-2-a-synapse-derived-csf-biomarker-in-genetic-frontotemporal-dementia/","publishdate":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/neuronal-pentraxin-2-a-synapse-derived-csf-biomarker-in-genetic-frontotemporal-dementia/","section":"publication","summary":"We conclude that NPTX2 is a promising synapse-derived disease progression biomarker in genetic FTD.","tags":["frontotemporal","pentraxin","CSF","biomarker"],"title":"Neuronal Pentraxin 2 - A Synapse-Derived CSF Biomarker in Genetic Frontotemporal Dementia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Miguel Tábuas-Pereira","Ricardo Varela","José Beato-Coelho","Diogo Maleita","et al"],"categories":null,"content":"Abstract Objectives: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is the most common hereditary cause of vascular dementia in adults.

Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is a measure of astrogliosis, a known pathological process of FTD, but has yet to be explored as potential biomarker.\nMethods: Plasma GFAP and neurofilament light chain (NfL) concentration were measured in 469 individuals enrolled in the Genetic FTD Initiative: 114 C9orf72 expansion carriers (74 presymptomatic, 40 symptomatic), 119 GRN mutation carriers (88 presymptomatic, 31 symptomatic), 53 MAPT mutation carriers (34 presymptomatic, 19 symptomatic) and 183 non-carrier controls. Biomarker measures were compared between groups using linear regression models adjusted for age and sex with family membership included as random effect. Participants underwent standardised clinical assessments including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration-Clinical Dementia Rating scale and MRI. Spearman\u0026rsquo;s correlation coefficient was used to investigate the relationship of plasma GFAP to clinical and imaging measures.\nResults: Plasma GFAP concentration was significantly increased in symptomatic GRN mutation carriers (adjusted mean difference from controls 192.3 pg/mL, 95% CI 126.5 to 445.6), but not in those with C9orf72 expansions (9.0, -61.3 to 54.6), MAPT mutations (12.7, -33.3 to 90.4) or the presymptomatic groups. GFAP concentration was significantly positively correlated with age in both controls and the majority of the disease groups, as well as with NfL concentration. In the presymptomatic period, higher GFAP concentrations were correlated with a lower cognitive score (MMSE) and lower brain volume, while in the symptomatic period, higher concentrations were associated with faster rates of atrophy in the temporal lobe.\nConclusions: Raised GFAP concentrations appear to be unique to GRN-related FTD, with levels potentially increasing just prior to symptom onset, suggesting that GFAP may be an important marker of proximity to onset, and helpful for forthcoming therapeutic prevention trials.\n","date":1583020800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583020800,"objectID":"124e2720401335006de99d5a079c6fac","permalink":"/publication/plasma-glial-fibrillary-acidic-protein-is-raised-in-progranulin-associated-frontotemporal-dementia/","publishdate":"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/plasma-glial-fibrillary-acidic-protein-is-raised-in-progranulin-associated-frontotemporal-dementia/","section":"publication","summary":"Raised GFAP concentrations appear to be unique to GRN-related FTD, with levels potentially increasing just prior to symptom onset, suggesting that GFAP may be an important marker of proximity to onset, and helpful for forthcoming therapeutic prevention trials","tags":["GRN","Progranulin","GFAP","frontotemporal","dementia"],"title":"Plasma Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein Is Raised in Progranulin-Associated Frontotemporal Dementia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Katrina M Moore","Jennifer Nicholas","Murray Grossman","(including Miguel Tábuas-Pereira)","et al"],"categories":null,"content":"Abstract\nBackground: Frontotemporal dementia is a heterogenous neurodegenerative disorder, with about a third of cases being genetic. Most of this genetic component is accounted for by mutations in GRN, MAPT, and C9orf72. In this study, we aimed to complement previous phenotypic studies by doing an international study of age at symptom onset, age at death, and disease duration in individuals with mutations in GRN, MAPT, and C9orf72.\nMethods: In this international, retrospective cohort study, we collected data on age at symptom onset, age at death, and disease duration for patients with pathogenic mutations in the GRN and MAPT genes and pathological expansions in the C9orf72 gene through the Frontotemporal Dementia Prevention Initiative and from published papers. We used mixed effects models to explore differences in age at onset, age at death, and disease duration between genetic groups and individual mutations. We also assessed correlations between the age at onset and at death of each individual and the age at onset and at death of their parents and the mean age at onset and at death of their family members. Lastly, we used mixed effects models to investigate the extent to which variability in age at onset and at death could be accounted for by family membership and the specific mutation carried.\nFindings: Data were available from 3403 individuals from 1492 families: 1433 with C9orf72 expansions (755 families), 1179 with GRN mutations (483 families, 130 different mutations), and 791 with MAPT mutations (254 families, 67 different mutations). Mean age at symptom onset and at death was 49·5 years (SD 10·0; onset) and 58·5 years (11·3; death) in the MAPT group, 58·2 years (9·8; onset) and 65·3 years (10·9; death) in the C9orf72 group, and 61·3 years (8·8; onset) and 68·8 years (9·7; death) in the GRN group. Mean disease duration was 6·4 years (SD 4·9) in the C9orf72 group, 7·1 years (3·9) in the GRN group, and 9·3 years (6·4) in the MAPT group. Individual age at onset and at death was significantly correlated with both parental age at onset and at death and with mean family age at onset and at death in all three groups, with a stronger correlation observed in the MAPT group (r=0·45 between individual and parental age at onset, r=0·63 between individual and mean family age at onset, r=0·58 between individual and parental age at death, and r=0·69 between individual and mean family age at death) than in either the C9orf72 group (r=0·32 individual and parental age at onset, r=0·36 individual and mean family age at onset, r=0·38 individual and parental age at death, and r=0·40 individual and mean family age at death) or the GRN group (r=0·22 individual and parental age at onset, r=0·18 individual and mean family age at onset, r=0·22 individual and parental age at death, and r=0·32 individual and mean family age at death). Modelling showed that the variability in age at onset and at death in the MAPT group was explained partly by the specific mutation (48%, 95% CI 35-62, for age at onset; 61%, 47-73, for age at death), and even more by family membership (66%, 56-75, for age at onset; 74%, 65-82, for age at death). In the GRN group, only 2% (0-10) of the variability of age at onset and 9% (3-21) of that of age of death was explained by the specific mutation, whereas 14% (9-22) of the variability of age at onset and 20% (12-30) of that of age at death was explained by family membership. In the C9orf72 group, family membership explained 17% (11-26) of the variability of age at onset and 19% (12-29) of that of age at death.\nInterpretation: Our study showed that age at symptom onset and at death of people with genetic frontotemporal dementia is influenced by genetic group and, particularly for MAPT mutations, by the specific mutation carried and by family membership. Although estimation of age at onset will be an important factor in future pre-symptomatic therapeutic trials for all three genetic groups, our study suggests that data from other members of the family will be particularly helpful only for individuals with MAPT mutations. Further work in identifying both genetic and environmental factors that modify phenotype in all groups will be important to improve such estimates.\nFunding: UK Medical Research Council, National Institute for Health Research, and Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s Society.\n","date":1580515200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580515200,"objectID":"5f99d8c86214e3284df6bc49fbd51ef5","permalink":"/publication/age-at-symptom-onset-and-death-and-disease-duration-in-genetic-frontotemporal-dementia/","publishdate":"2020-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/age-at-symptom-onset-and-death-and-disease-duration-in-genetic-frontotemporal-dementia/","section":"publication","summary":"Our study showed that age at symptom onset and at death of people with genetic frontotemporal dementia is influenced by genetic group and, particularly for MAPT mutations, by the specific mutation carried and by family membership.","tags":["frontotemporal","progranulin","MAPT","c9orf72"],"title":"Age at Symptom Onset and Death and Disease Duration in Genetic Frontotemporal Dementia - An International Retrospective Cohort Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Miguel Tábuas-Pereira","José Beato-Coelho","Joana Ribeiro","Ana Rita Nogueira","et al"],"categories":null,"content":"Abstract\nPurpose: Better understanding of clinical predictors of aphasia outcome is of the utmost importance, in patients\u0026rsquo; rehabilitation planning, expectation management, and further physiopathology understanding.

A better understanding of NfL dynamics is essential for upcoming therapeutic trials. We aimed to study longitudinal NfL trajectories in people with presymptomatic and symptomatic genetic frontotemporal dementia.\nMethods: We recruited participants from 14 centres collaborating in the Genetic Frontotemporal Dementia Initiative (GENFI), which is a multicentre cohort study of families with genetic frontotemporal dementia done across Europe and Canada. Eligible participants (aged ≥18 years) either had frontotemporal dementia due to a pathogenic mutation in GRN, C9orf72, or MAPT (symptomatic mutation carriers) or were healthy at-risk first-degree relatives (either presymptomatic mutation carriers or non-carriers), and had at least two serum samples with a time interval of 6 months or more. Participants were excluded if they had neurological comorbidities that were likely to affect NfL, including cerebrovascular events. We measured NfL longitudinally in serum samples collected between June 8, 2012, and Dec 8, 2017, through follow-up visits annually or every 2 years, which also included MRI and neuropsychological assessments. Using mixed-effects models, we analysed NfL changes over time and correlated them with longitudinal imaging and clinical parameters, controlling for age, sex, and study site. The primary outcome was the course of NfL over time in the various stages of genetic frontotemporal dementia.\nFindings: We included 59 symptomatic carriers and 149 presymptomatic carriers of a mutation in GRN, C9orf72, or MAPT, and 127 non-carriers. Nine presymptomatic carriers became symptomatic during follow-up (so-called converters). Baseline NfL was elevated in symptomatic carriers (median 52 pg/mL [IQR 24-69]) compared with presymptomatic carriers (9 pg/mL [6-13]; p\u0026lt;0·0001) and non-carriers (8 pg/mL [6-11]; p\u0026lt;0·0001), and was higher in converters than in non-converting carriers (19 pg/mL [17-28] vs 8 pg/mL [6-11]; p=0·0007; adjusted for age). During follow-up, NfL increased in converters (b=0·097 [SE 0·018]; p\u0026lt;0·0001). In symptomatic mutation carriers overall, NfL did not change during follow-up (b=0·017 [SE 0·010]; p=0·101) and remained elevated. Rates of NfL change over time were associated with rate of decline in Mini Mental State Examination (b=-94·7 [SE 33·9]; p=0·003) and atrophy rate in several grey matter regions, but not with change in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration-Clinical Dementia Rating scale score (b=-3·46 [SE 46·3]; p=0·941).\nInterpretation: Our findings show the value of blood NfL as a disease progression biomarker in genetic frontotemporal dementia and suggest that longitudinal NfL measurements could identify mutation carriers approaching symptom onset and capture rates of brain atrophy.

After this point, functional network efficiency declines markedly. Reduction in connectedness was most marked in highly connected hub regions. Measures of topological efficiency of the brain\u0026rsquo;s functional network and organization predicted cognitive dysfunction in domains related to symptomatic frontotemporal dementia and connectivity correlated with brain volume loss in frontotemporal dementia.

Dynamic network analysis based on resting-state magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is a potentially powerful tool for the study of preclinical FTD. In the present study, we employed a \u0026ldquo;chronnectome\u0026rdquo; approach (recurring, time-varying patterns of connectivity) to evaluate measures of dynamic connectivity in 472 at-risk FTD subjects from the Genetic Frontotemporal dementia research Initiative (GENFI) cohort. We considered 249 subjects with FTD-related pathogenetic mutations and 223 mutation non-carriers (HC). Dynamic connectivity was evaluated using independent component analysis and sliding-time window correlation to rs-fMRI data, and meta-state measures of global brain flexibility were extracted. Results show that presymptomatic FTD exhibits diminished dynamic fluidity, visiting less meta-states, shifting less often across them, and travelling through a narrowed meta-state distance, as compared to HC. Dynamic connectivity changes characterize preclinical FTD, arguing for the desynchronization of the inner fluctuations of the brain. These changes antedate clinical symptoms, and might represent an early signature of FTD to be used as a biomarker in clinical trials.\nKeywords: C9orf72; Chronnectome; Dynamic brain functional connectivity; Frontotemporal dementia; Granulin; Microtuble associate protein tau; Mutation; resting-state fMRI.\n","date":1554076800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554076800,"objectID":"68a6ec093e1ced141fac053bca2e7b61","permalink":"/publication/the-inner-fluctuations-of-the-brain-in-presymptomatic-frontotemporal-dementia-the-chronnectome-fingerprint/","publishdate":"2019-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/the-inner-fluctuations-of-the-brain-in-presymptomatic-frontotemporal-dementia-the-chronnectome-fingerprint/","section":"publication","summary":"Results show that presymptomatic FTD exhibits diminished dynamic fluidity, visiting less meta-states, shifting less often across them, and travelling through a narrowed meta-state distance, as compared to HC.

We aimed to study if C9ORF72 expansion is linked to a higher prevalence of melanoma.\nMethods: We selected patients with a diagnosis in the ALS-FTLD spectrum who were tested for pathogenic mutations. Medical history was reviewed, to identify those with pathologically documented melanomas.\nResults: We included 189 patients. Sixty-two had identified pathogenic mutations (39 C9ORF72). C9ORF72 carriers had a significantly higher risk of melanoma (odds ratio = 24.709; P \u0026lt; 0.007). There was no association with phenotype.\nConclusions: These findings suggest that patients with a history of melanoma may have an increased probability of carrying a C9ORF72 repeat expansion.

The Aphasia Rapid Test is a 26-point scale developed as a bedside assessment to rate aphasia severity in acute stroke patients in less than 3 minutes. We aimed to adapt and validate this scale for European Portuguese.\nMaterial and methods: We evaluated 56 acute stroke patients in the first and in the seventh days post-stroke. In the seventh day, patients were evaluated by two independent raters, to evaluate inter-rater agreement. To study concurrent validity, the Lisbon Aphasia Examination Battery was applied to a subset of 20 patients. The predictive ability of the Aphasia Rapid Test was assessed at six months, by the aphasia subscale of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale.\nResults: Translation to European Portuguese was based in the French and English versions, considering the words\u0026rsquo; utilization frequency. The Chronbach\u0026rsquo;s alpha was 0.796. The concordance coefficient between the two raters was excellent (0.985). Correlation between Aphasia Rapid Test and the Lisbon Aphasia Examination Battery was strong (r = -0.958, p \u0026lt; 0.001). The study through Bland-Altman graphs corroborated the good inter-rater agreement and concurrent validity of the test. The Aphasia Rapid Test score in the first day is an independent predictor of long-term outcome.\nDiscussion: This study provides reliable results for European Portuguese, with adequate internal consistency, inter-rater agreement and concurrent validity.\nConclusion: The Aphasia Rapid Test is a good tool for the evaluation and monitoring of aphasia in stroke patients.\n","date":1525132800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1525132800,"objectID":"78944c93f6e0203755cd0fb761c7c8bd","permalink":"/publication/aphasia-rapid-test-translation-adaptation-and-validation-studies-for-the-portuguese-population/","publishdate":"2018-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/aphasia-rapid-test-translation-adaptation-and-validation-studies-for-the-portuguese-population/","section":"publication","summary":"This study provides reliable results for European Portuguese, with adequate internal consistency, inter-rater agreement and concurrent validity.","tags":["Aphasia","scale","stroke"],"title":"","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diana Duro","Miguel Tábuas-Pereira","Sandra Freitas","et al"],"categories":null,"content":"Abstract\nThe Clock Drawing Test (CDT) has a known potential for the detection of cognitive impairment in populations with dementia, especially Alzheimer disease (AD).

However, CSF biomarker-based classification often results in conflicting profiles with controversial prognostic value. Normalization of the CSF Aβ42 concentration to the level of total amyloid beta (Aβ), using the Aβ42/40 ratio, has been shown to improve the distinction between AD and non-AD dementia. Therefore, we evaluated whether the Aβ42/40 ratio would improve MCI categorization and more accurately predict progression to AD.\nMethods: Our baseline population consisted of 197 MCI patients, of which 144 had a follow-up ≥ 2 years, and comprised the longitudinal study group. To establish our own CSF Aβ42/40 ratio reference value, a group of 168 AD-dementia patients and 66 neurological controls was also included. CSF biomarker-based classification was operationalized according to the framework of the National Institute of Aging-Alzheimer Association criteria for MCI.\nResults: When using the core CSF biomarkers (Aβ42, total Tau and phosphorylated Tau), 30% of the patients fell into the high-AD-likelihood (HL) group (both amyloid and neurodegeneration markers positive), 30% into the low-AD-likelihood group (all biomarkers negative), 28% into the suspected non-Alzheimer pathophysiology (SNAP) group (only neurodegeneration markers positive) and 12% into the isolated amyloid pathology group (only amyloid-positive). Replacing Aβ42 by the Aβ42/40 ratio resulted in a significant increase in the percentage of patients with amyloidosis (42-59%) and in the proportion of interpretable biological profiles (61-75%), due to a reduction by half in the number of SNAP cases and an increase in the proportion of the HL subgroup. Survival analysis showed that risk of progression to AD was highest in the HL group, and increased when the Aβ42/40 ratio, instead of Aβ42, combined with total Tau and phosphorylated Tau was used for biomarker-based categorization.\nConclusions: Our results confirm the usefulness of the CSF Aβ42/40 ratio in the interpretation of CSF biomarker profiles in MCI patients, by increasing the proportion of conclusive profiles and enhancing their predictive value for underlying AD.\nKeywords: Alzheimer’s disease; Aβ42/40 ratio; CSF biomarkers; Mild cognitive impairment.\n","date":1519862400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1519862400,"objectID":"ae087a33a22dde0c8946fb8974684893","permalink":"/publication/addition-of-the-a%CE%B24240-ratio-to-the-cerebrospinal-fluid-biomarker-profile-increases-the-predictive-value-for-underlying-alzheimers-disease-dementia-in-mild-cognitive-impairment/","publishdate":"2018-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/addition-of-the-a%CE%B24240-ratio-to-the-cerebrospinal-fluid-biomarker-profile-increases-the-predictive-value-for-underlying-alzheimers-disease-dementia-in-mild-cognitive-impairment/","section":"publication","summary":"Our results confirm the usefulness of the CSF Aβ42/40 ratio in the interpretation of CSF biomarker profiles in MCI patients, by increasing the proportion of conclusive profiles and enhancing their predictive value for underlying AD.","tags":["Alzheimer","amyloid","CSF","Mild Cognitive Impairment","biomarker"],"title":"Addition of the Aβ42/40 Ratio to the Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarker Profile Increases the Predictive Value for Underlying Alzheimer's Disease Dementia in Mild Cognitive Impairment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Joana Nogueira","Sandra Freitas","Diana Duro","Miguel Tábuas-Pereira","et al"],"categories":null,"content":"Abstract\nIntroduction: The Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale is a brief battery developed to assess cognitive functioning in Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s disease that encompasses the core characteristics of cognitive decline (e.g. memory, language, praxis, constructive ability and orientation). The early detection, as well as the monitoring of cognitive decline along disease progression, is extremely important in clinical care and interventional research. The main goals of the present study were to analyze the psychometric properties of the Portuguese version of the Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale, and to establish normative values for the Portuguese population.\nMaterial and methods: The Portuguese version of Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale was administered to 223 cognitively healthy participants according to a standard assessment protocol consisting of the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and the Adults and Older Adults Functional Assessment Inventory. Normal performance on the assessment protocol was the inclusion criteria for the study.\nResults: The Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale revealed good psychometric properties when used in the Portuguese population. Age was the main predictor of the Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale total score (R2 = 0.123), whereas the influence of education level was lower (R2 = 0.027). These two variables explained 14.4% of the variance on the Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale scores and were used to stratify the normative values for the Portuguese population presented here.\nConclusion: On the total sample, the average total score in the Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale was 6 points.

Neurosonology offers a noninvasive method to study the cervicocephalic circulation when a vascular etiology is suspected. We aim to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a vascular neurosonological exam in isolated acute vestibular syndrome.\nMethods: All patients submitted to cerebrovascular ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging during the period between 2011 and 2015 with acute isolated vestibular syndrome. Those with any clinical sign of brainstem lesion on presentation were excluded. All patients performed the neuroimaging study (brain computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) and neurologic surveillance. Neurosonological exam included all intra- and extracranial segments of the vertebrobasilar circulation. Positive ultrasound exam was defined as the presence of stenotic or occlusive disease in any of these segments related to the infarcted area.\nResults: A total of 108 patients were included: 60 (53.6%) were males (mean age: 60.75 years (standard deviation, 14.17)). In 27 patients (25.0%) a cerebral ischemic lesion was found to be the cause of the vertigo. Neurosonological assessment showed a sensitivity of 40.7% (95% confidence interval (CI): 22.4; 61.2), specificity of 100% (95% CI: 95.5; 100.0), positive predictive value (PPV) of 100% (95% CI: 71.5; 100.0), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 83.5% (95% CI: 74.6; 90.3).\nConclusions: Our study suggests that cerebrovascular ultrasound is a highly specific method for the diagnosis of cerebrovascular vertigo.

Together with the Apolipoprotein E-ε4 allele (ApoE-ε4), the BuChE-K variant has been proposed to increase AD risk in certain populations. In addition, this polymorphism has been associated with a lower capacity to attenuate β-amyloid aggregation. In the present study we explored the interaction of the BuChE-K variant with its activity in CSF, conventional AD biomarkers and ApoE genotype. 217 AD patients and 200 age-matched controls were genotyped for the ApoE and the BuChE-K variant. BuChE activity in CSF, as well as the levels of the CSF-AD biomarkers amyloid-beta 42 (Aβ42), total and hyperphosphorylated tau (t-tau and p-tau) were determined in 88 of these patients. The results showed no significant differences in the BuChE-K variant distribution between patients and controls. No influence of the BuChE-K variant was seen neither in CSF BuChE activity, nor in the levels of Aβ42, t-tau and p-tau in AD patients. ApoE genotype also did not seem to influence CSF BuChE activity. Interestingly, in AD patients, an association between high CSF BuChE activity and increased levels of CSF Aβ42 was shown, particularly in ApoE-ε4 allele carriers. In our population, the BuChE-K variant does not seem to confer risk for AD or to influence the activity of the enzyme in CSF. However, we demonstrated an association between BuChE activity, ApoE-ε4 genotype and CSF Aβ42 levels, highlighting the importance of assessing BuChE activity as a possible modulator of Aβ load in the brain.\nKeywords: Alzheimeŕs disease; Amyloid-beta 42; Apolipoprotein E; Butyrylcholinesterase; Cerebrospinal fluid.\n","date":1485907200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1485907200,"objectID":"5bd49a89ac920bd1e1420375170df952","permalink":"/publication/association-between-butyrylcholinesterase-and-cerebrospinal-fluid-biomarkers-in-alzheimers-disease-patients/","publishdate":"2017-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/association-between-butyrylcholinesterase-and-cerebrospinal-fluid-biomarkers-in-alzheimers-disease-patients/","section":"publication","summary":"In our population, the BuChE-K variant does not seem to confer risk for AD or to influence the activity of the enzyme in CSF.

The central nervous system (CNS) is secondarily involved in 43% of patients; 5% of patients have isolated or primary CNS involvement. The most frequent CNS symptoms are cognitive changes. Prosopagnosia is an inability to recognize familiar faces, in a person who does not have vision impairments or cognitive alterations. This relatively rare condition is usually related to vascular, traumatic, degenerative, or infectious lesions. We report a 54-year-old woman who presented subacutely with fever, headache, and seizures that led to a diagnosis of infectious meningoencephalitis. She improved temporarily on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but then developed a chronically evolving cognitive impairment with associative prosopagnosia as the major complaint. She had a history of sporadic abdominal pain and mild sacroiliac arthralgia. After a negative duodenal biopsy, we confirmed primary CNS Whipple disease by polymerase chain reaction and brain biopsy. We treated the patient with ceftriaxone for 15 days and then co-trimoxazole for 2 years. At 8-year follow-up, she had no further impairments, but continuing prosopagnosia. To our knowledge, this is the first description of isolated prosopagnosia in a patient with primary CNS Whipple disease.

Early Onset Mild Cognitive Impairment (EOMCI) is a less characterized group. The aim of this study is to characterize MCI probably due to AD in terms of the clinical, genetic, Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers profile and conversion rate of EOMCI, compared to the late-onset form (LOMCI).\nMethods: 159 MCI patients were divided in two groups: 52 EOMCI (onset \u0026lt; 65 years) and 107 LOMCI (onset ≥ 65 years). We investigated differences in neuropsychological scores, clinical variables, ApoE genotype, CSF biomarkers (Aβ42, t-Tau and p-Tau) in both groups. Conversion was ascertained during follow-up.\nResults: EOMCI showed a longer duration of symptoms prior to the first evaluation (EOMCI = 4.57 vs. LOMCI = 3.31, p = 0.008) and scored higher on the subjective memory complaints scale (9.91 vs. 7.85, p = 0.008), but performed better in brief cognitive tests (27.81 vs. 26.51, p \u0026lt; 0.001 in Mini-Mental State Examination; 19.84 vs. 18.67, p = 0.005 in Montreal Cognitive Assessment) than LOMCI.

The posterior variant of AD has two subtypes: occipitotemporal, presenting with visuoperceptive impairment, and biparietal, presenting with visuospatial dysfunction and apraxia. We report a case of a 51-year-old woman with progressive limb apraxia and choreiform movements. Her neuropsychological evaluation was compatible with dementia, and revealed ideomotor and ideational limb apraxia, severe visuoconstructive ability impairment, dyscalculia and posterior aphasia. Workup excluded metabolic, infectious, inflammatory or neoplastic causes, and hereditary conditions as Huntington\u0026rsquo;s disease and familial AD. Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers revealed β-amyloid reduction and τ protein increase. Brain imaging showed marked biparietal atrophy and hypoperfusion, and widespread cortical β-amyloid deposition. Biparietal variant of AD was diagnosed and acetylcholinesterase inhibitor treatment induced clinical stabilisation. AD may present with atypical features and a high clinical suspicion is necessary for an early diagnosis.\n","date":1422748800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1422748800,"objectID":"b56065915a691074c3bca4d735273801","permalink":"/publication/biparietal-variant-of-alzheimers-disease-a-rare-presentation-of-a-common-disease/","publishdate":"2015-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/biparietal-variant-of-alzheimers-disease-a-rare-presentation-of-a-common-disease/","section":"publication","summary":"AD may present with atypical features and a high clinical suspicion is necessary for an early diagnosis.
