      <description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Background/aims: The head turning sign (HTS) is frequently noticed in clinical practice, but few studies have investigated its etiological and neuropsychological correlates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods: The presence and frequency of the HTS was operationalized and prospectively evaluated in patients with Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples for AD biomarkers were collected. Mini-Mental State Examination, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and insight scale scores were ascertained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results: A total of 84 patients were included. The HTS was more prevalent in AD than in MCI or bvFTD. It correlated negatively with cognitive measures and depression. It also had a positive correlation with CSF total tau and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. Total tau protein and GDS score were the only variables independently associated with the HTS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The presence of the HTS in a cognitively impaired individual suggests a diagnosis of AD. A higher HTS frequency correlates with higher CSF total tau levels, a smaller GDS score, and worse cognitive measures. In the MCI subgroup, the HTS may suggest a higher risk of progression.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tremor Frequency Assessment by iPhone® Applications - Correlation With EMG Analysis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tremor frequency analysis is usually performed by EMG studies but accelerometers are progressively being more used. The iPhone® contains an accelerometer and many applications claim to be capable of measuring tremor frequency. We tested three applications in twenty-two patients with a diagnosis of PD, ET and Holmes&amp;rsquo; tremor. EMG needle assessment as well as accelerometry was performed at the same time. There was very strong correlation (Pearson &amp;gt;0.8, p &amp;lt; 0.001) between the three applications, the EMG needle and the accelerometry. Our data suggests the apps LiftPulse®, iSeismometer® and Studymytremor® are a reliable alternative to the EMG for tremor frequency assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
