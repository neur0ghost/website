      <description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frontotemporal lobar degeneration, the neuropathological substrate of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), is characterized by the deposition of protein aggregates, including tau. Evidence has shown concomitant amyloid pathology in some of these patients, which seems to contribute to a more aggressive disease. Our aim was to evaluate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-beta as a predictor of the mortality of FTD patients. We included 99 patients diagnosed with FTD-both behavioral and language variants-with no associated motor neuron disease, from whom a CSF sample was collected. These patients were followed prospectively in our center, and demographic and clinical data were obtained. The survival analysis was carried through a Cox regression model. Patients who died during follow up had a significantly lower CSF amyloid-beta1-42 than those who did not. The survival analysis demonstrated that an increased death rate was associated with a lower CSF amyloid-beta1-42 (HR = 0.999, 95% CI = [0.997, 1.000], p = 0.049). Neither demographic nor clinical variables, nor CSF total tau or p-tau were significantly associated with this endpoint. These results suggest that amyloid deposition in FTD patients may be associated with a higher mortality.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Increased CSF Tau Is Associated With a Higher Risk of Seizures in Patients With Alzheimer&#39;s Disease</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Neurofibrillary tangles and tau protein, the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), have been identified in patients with epilepsy. Tau protein was also associated with the modulation of neuronal excitability in animal models of AD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials and methods: We evaluated in 292 patients with AD the association between the risk of seizure development and AD cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, demographic characteristics, baseline Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, comorbidities, and apolipoprotein E status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results: The development of seizures was associated with younger age at dementia&amp;rsquo;s onset, lower baseline MMSE, and higher CSF total tau protein levels, but only MMSE (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.935; 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.903, 0.968]; p &amp;lt; 0.001) and CSF tau (HR = 1.001; 95%CI = [1.001, 1.002]; p = 0.001) were independent predictors on multivariate analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussion: While CSF tau and lower baseline MMSE association with seizure development could in part be explained by a greater degree of cortical damage, the role of tau in the modulation of neuronal excitability may also play a role and should be further investigated.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Head Turning Sign in Dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment - Its Relationship to Cognition, Behavior, and Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Background/aims: The head turning sign (HTS) is frequently noticed in clinical practice, but few studies have investigated its etiological and neuropsychological correlates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods: The presence and frequency of the HTS was operationalized and prospectively evaluated in patients with Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples for AD biomarkers were collected. Mini-Mental State Examination, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and insight scale scores were ascertained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results: A total of 84 patients were included. The HTS was more prevalent in AD than in MCI or bvFTD. It correlated negatively with cognitive measures and depression. It also had a positive correlation with CSF total tau and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. Total tau protein and GDS score were the only variables independently associated with the HTS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The presence of the HTS in a cognitively impaired individual suggests a diagnosis of AD. A higher HTS frequency correlates with higher CSF total tau levels, a smaller GDS score, and worse cognitive measures. In the MCI subgroup, the HTS may suggest a higher risk of progression.&lt;/p&gt;
