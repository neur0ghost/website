      <description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tremor frequency analysis is usually performed by EMG studies but accelerometers are progressively being more used. The iPhone® contains an accelerometer and many applications claim to be capable of measuring tremor frequency. We tested three applications in twenty-two patients with a diagnosis of PD, ET and Holmes&amp;rsquo; tremor. EMG needle assessment as well as accelerometry was performed at the same time. There was very strong correlation (Pearson &amp;gt;0.8, p &amp;lt; 0.001) between the three applications, the EMG needle and the accelerometry. Our data suggests the apps LiftPulse®, iSeismometer® and Studymytremor® are a reliable alternative to the EMG for tremor frequency assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
