      <description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Neurofibrillary tangles and tau protein, the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), have been identified in patients with epilepsy. Tau protein was also associated with the modulation of neuronal excitability in animal models of AD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials and methods: We evaluated in 292 patients with AD the association between the risk of seizure development and AD cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, demographic characteristics, baseline Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, comorbidities, and apolipoprotein E status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results: The development of seizures was associated with younger age at dementia&amp;rsquo;s onset, lower baseline MMSE, and higher CSF total tau protein levels, but only MMSE (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.935; 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.903, 0.968]; p &amp;lt; 0.001) and CSF tau (HR = 1.001; 95%CI = [1.001, 1.002]; p = 0.001) were independent predictors on multivariate analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussion: While CSF tau and lower baseline MMSE association with seizure development could in part be explained by a greater degree of cortical damage, the role of tau in the modulation of neuronal excitability may also play a role and should be further investigated.&lt;/p&gt;
