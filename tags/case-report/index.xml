      <title>Prosopagnosia as the Presenting Symptom of Whipple Disease</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whipple disease is a rare, chronic multisystem infectious disease. The central nervous system (CNS) is secondarily involved in 43% of patients; 5% of patients have isolated or primary CNS involvement. The most frequent CNS symptoms are cognitive changes. Prosopagnosia is an inability to recognize familiar faces, in a person who does not have vision impairments or cognitive alterations. This relatively rare condition is usually related to vascular, traumatic, degenerative, or infectious lesions. We report a 54-year-old woman who presented subacutely with fever, headache, and seizures that led to a diagnosis of infectious meningoencephalitis. She improved temporarily on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but then developed a chronically evolving cognitive impairment with associative prosopagnosia as the major complaint. She had a history of sporadic abdominal pain and mild sacroiliac arthralgia. After a negative duodenal biopsy, we confirmed primary CNS Whipple disease by polymerase chain reaction and brain biopsy. We treated the patient with ceftriaxone for 15 days and then co-trimoxazole for 2 years. At 8-year follow-up, she had no further impairments, but continuing prosopagnosia. To our knowledge, this is the first description of isolated prosopagnosia in a patient with primary CNS Whipple disease. Because CNS Whipple disease can lead to serious, irreversible lesions if not promptly treated, clinicians must suspect the diagnosis, treat with long-term antibiotics, and follow patients carefully to prevent recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) is a clinically heterogeneous disease that may have atypical presentations with focal cortical syndromes and relatively preserved episodic memory. The posterior variant of AD has two subtypes: occipitotemporal, presenting with visuoperceptive impairment, and biparietal, presenting with visuospatial dysfunction and apraxia. We report a case of a 51-year-old woman with progressive limb apraxia and choreiform movements. Her neuropsychological evaluation was compatible with dementia, and revealed ideomotor and ideational limb apraxia, severe visuoconstructive ability impairment, dyscalculia and posterior aphasia. Workup excluded metabolic, infectious, inflammatory or neoplastic causes, and hereditary conditions as Huntington&amp;rsquo;s disease and familial AD. Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers revealed β-amyloid reduction and τ protein increase. Brain imaging showed marked biparietal atrophy and hypoperfusion, and widespread cortical β-amyloid deposition. Biparietal variant of AD was diagnosed and acetylcholinesterase inhibitor treatment induced clinical stabilisation. AD may present with atypical features and a high clinical suspicion is necessary for an early diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
