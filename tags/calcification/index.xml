      <description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Background: Calcifications are an important element of atherosclerotic plaques and have been used as a marker of atherosclerosis and clinical outcome predictor in different vascular territories. CT-scan, performed in the acute ischemic stroke setting, can reliably detect intracranial arterial calcifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objectives: To investigate the association between intracranial internal carotid artery calcification and functional outcome, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH), recanalization, and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods: We included 396 consecutive ischemic stroke patients submitted to recombinant tissue plasminogen activator treatment between January 2011 and September 2014. Admission CT-scans were reviewed to calculate the Total Carotid Syphon Calcification score. Patients were followed for up to at least 6 months post-stroke or until death. Outcome measures included evaluation of recanalization on the first 24 h (transcranial color coded Doppler or angio-CT), sICH, and assessment of functional outcome at 3 months after stroke (using modified Rankin scale).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results: Carotid artery wall calcification did not predict sICH, recanalization or any good outcome. However, it was a statistically significant predictor of death (OR 1.102, 95% CI [1.004-1.211], p = 0.042).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussion: Intracranial carotid artery calcification does not increase the risk of thrombolysis-induced sICH. Patients with higher grade of carotid artery wall calcification may have a higher mortality rate.&lt;/p&gt;
